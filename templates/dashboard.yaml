    This interactive webpage shows the scheduled and actual hours of power outages reported by households in Ukraine each day across 15 different administrative regions (oblasts). 
    Data collection is commissioned by the Green Deal Ukraïna project and collected daily via a survey. Each daily value per region is the average of two sub-queues of consumers.
    Consumers in Ukraine are divided into 12 sub-queues per region, each with a roughly equal electricity demand.
    Scheduled outages are intended by the authorities to be equally distributed across sub-queues within a region.
    As we add new data, more dates will become available from the drop down list below.
